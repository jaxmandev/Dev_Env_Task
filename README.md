# Dev Environment set-up with Vagrant

1. Installation and Setup for Vagrant, VirtualBox, and Ruby

*[Ruby installation for MAC](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/)* 
- Current version is 2.6.6
*[Vagrant installation for MAC](https://www.vagrantup.com/)*
- Current version is 2.2.7
*[Virtual Box installation for MAC](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)*
- - Current version is 6.1

#### Installation Guide

- Vagrantfile set-up

1. In the starter-code directory, there should already be a Vagrantfile set up with the following features:
```
- Check if hostsupdater plugin is installed (if not, then install)
- Configure the Vagrant Box to Ubuntu 18.04 ubuntu/bionic64
- Configure private network with ip 192.168.10.100
- Configure hostname alias with development.local
- Provision /app and /environment folders to VM
```

The Vagrantfile should look as follows
```
# Install required plugins
required_plugins = ["vagrant-hostsupdater"]
required_plugins.each do |plugin|
    exec "vagrant plugin install #{plugin}" unless Vagrant.has_plugin? plugin
end

Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
	# configure vagrant box to Ubuntu 18.04
	config.vm.box = "ubuntu/bionic64"

	# configure network ip and hostname alias
	config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.10.100"
	config.hostsupdater.aliases = ["development.local"]

	# sync folders to VM
	config.vm.sync_folder "/app", "app"
	config.vm.sync_folder "/environment", "environment"
end
```
If there are any issues with the Vagrantfile you can make a new one with terminal in your current working directory with the following command, and add the above code to your newly created Vagrantfile
```
vagrant init
```

###Â Requirements

- This project primarily uses JavaScript, with some integration testing with Ruby and Rake

### Setting Up Testing with Ruby

Testing is carried out with the Rake testing framework with Ruby, used to ensure that everything is set up and running correctly.

- In starter-code/environment/ there is the spec-test folder which contains:
spec which contains the specific unit tests that rspec will refer to
1. Gemfile which contains a list of gems (packages) that must be installed in order to run the tests
2. Rakefile which contains the set of instructions to execute the tests
.rspec which can be ignored for now


- In order to install all the gems listed in Gemfile, first install bundler1. 
Bundler is Ruby's package manager, which can be installed in terminal with
```
gem install bundler
```
After this is successfully carried out, ensure that the terminal's current working directory is starter-code/environment/spec-test so that it can refer to the Gemfile and run
```
bundle
```
This will install all the gems listed in Gemfile, the tests are now ready to be run with
```
rake spec
```
